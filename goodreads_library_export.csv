I too agree that the book was at times redundant and could have been written better from a literary perspective. However, I also think that what makes a memoir notable is the writer’s ability to be raw and vulnerable in rehashing one’s experience. <br/><br/>Perry made no effort to sugar coat his experiences or make himself look pretty and I think that’s admirable because of the honest perspective he’s given us regarding how ugly depression and addiction can get and how the diseases strip someone of any character they may have once had. One of his cruder remarks was that he would have “even fucked mud” [at that time in his life]. Again, though I agree this can be perceived as offensive, I think it goes a lot deeper than that to show just how the diseases manifested within him. This comment is not at all representative of the women in his life at this time (and he does remark on this), but of his complete inability to grasp reality. I would even argue that I’m glad he included this comment to highlight just how much addiction and depression rob someone. His standards and self worth were questionable because his reality was questionable. Though it is never okay to belittle others, I did not perceive this comment as that as much as a perfect summary of him being so desperate for touch and affection, that he would have settled for the cold touch of mud over the solace of his own thoughts. <br/><br/>If you are looking for an honest book that illustrates the savages of depression and addiction, this could be it. Yes, it’s redundant- but doesn’t that only further illustrate his sadness if he’s so stuck on the things he repeats again and again? This isn’t written for literary grandeur. This is written to illustrate how evil addiction and depression are and how far people go to hide their messy lives- even if that means almost dying several times in the process. <br/><br/>Shouldn’t we try to understand his sadness as a means to help others in similar positions, rather than condemn him for not being a literary genius when at one of his lowest points?",,,1,0

To call her full of herself is to say that her life as the opposite gender is anything but brave; her fight for Afghanistan is anything but a hero's work; her position as an elected official (being one of few to not buy votes) is anything but inspiring; and her dreams for female education and women's right to vote is anything but fair. To dismiss her accomplishments because of the proudness with which she speaks of them is to suggest that she does not deserve to be proud. More significantly, this takes away the focus from the topic with which she is trying to emphasize: the injustices faced by Afghan women and her fight as a man to bring some of these to light. Ukmina considers herself ""strong as a man, and kind as a woman."" With this, I disagree. I would consider Ukmina's strength to surpass that of most men. ",,,1,0
