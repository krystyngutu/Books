# Book Analysis
This project analyzes my reading history and preferences. It collects info on books I've read and want to read, allowing me to explore patterns, visualize insights, and build custom prediction models based on my preferences.

---
## Project Goals
- Aggregate book data
- Analyze historical reading patterns
- Predict future book preferences
- Explore trends in genres, authors, ratings, etc.

---
## Features Collected
Each book has the following attributes:

- **Title**
- **Author**
- **Average Rating**
- **My Rating**
- **Review**
- **Date Published**
- **Date Added**
- **Date Started**
- **Date Read**
- **Shelves** (i.e., `to-read`, `read`, `currently-reading`)
- **Pages**
- **Book Link**
- **Summary**
- **Genres**

---
## Tools
- **Python**: Core language for scripting
- **BeautifulSoup**: Web scraping
- **Pandas**: Data processing and manipulation
- **Regex**: Cleaning and extracting structured data
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** (planned): Visualization of reading trends
- **Scikit-learn / XGBoost** (planned): Predictive modeling

---
## Output
The final dataset is saved as a `.csv` file and includes books with the above features. I plan to use it to build dashboards, run stats, train recommendation algorithms, etc.
